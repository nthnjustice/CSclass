NEEDHAM, Mass. — Four days after the Boston Marathon bombings, Ali Tepsurkaev was at work on a construction site on Nantucket when his boss approached him to deliver the news: the two prime suspects had been identified as ethnic Chechens. For Mr. Tepsurkaev, 33, who fled the wars in Chechnya more than a decade ago, immediate disbelief turned quickly to fear and despair. The violence that had once consumed his homeland had found him again, this time shattering the quiet refuge he had found here in NewEngland.

“I was so upset, I couldn’t work,” said Mr. Tepsurkaev, who soon left his Nantucket home to be with his extended family here in Needham, a Boston suburb. “I left my guys. I couldn’t finish. It felt so horrible.”

Until a few days ago, most Chechens in the United States lived largely anonymous lives. Few Americans even knew what and where Chechnya was.

Now, two Chechen brothers are at the center of one of the most serious terrorist attacks on the United States since Sept. 11, 2001. While the motivations behind the bombings are still unknown, the attack has made Chechnya, a mostly Muslim region in Russia, a focus of American scrutiny, and it has thrust Chechens living here into an unwanted spotlight.

Several Chechens in the Boston area and elsewhere said the attack had left them feeling exposed — and embarrassed. Some worry about being branded terrorists in a country that they credit with offering them sanctuary.

For most of them, the attacks raised fears that their past was somehow catching up with them. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed in two vicious wars between Russian troops and Chechen separatists in the 1990s and early 2000s. The wars led to widespread destruction in Chechnya and spawned a violent Islamist insurgency that created even more misery.

Many Chechens fled, taking their traumas and battle scars with them. Most stayed in Europe. But a handful, perhaps no more than a thousand, came to the United States, where few expected to see the kind of the indiscriminate slaughter that had engulfed their homeland, particularly an attack committed by fellow Chechens.

Mr. Tepsurkaev, who has a wife and 3-year-old daughter, said seeing two Chechens held responsible for the Boston attack had left him feeling irrational guilt.

“Most of us would be dead right now if it wasn’t for the United States giving us a home and saving us from all the violence,” he said. “It feels embarrassing for us. After all this hospitality we’re getting from Americans, to hear that some Chechen....” he said, breaking off. “It’s hard. It’s difficult to explain.”

He spoke with a reporter over tea at his uncle’s house across from a playground here in Needham, about 10 miles from the bombing suspects’ home in Cambridge.

He was surrounded by cousins close to the age of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, the younger of the two suspects, who was taken into custody on Friday. Two of the cousins, Islam and Maryam Baiev, are planning to go to college in the fall to pursue careers in medicine. They speak English with no accent, but can still banter easily in both Chechen and Russian.

“I remember them in the dungeon just hiding from the bombs,” Mr. Tepsurkaev said of his cousins. “They’ve seen the screaming, they’ve seen the blood, but as you see they’re getting educated here, trying to get into college and living their lives. No hate, no violence. They’ve seen it, that’s why they appreciate it even more.”

“But these guys who haven’t seen anything,” he said about the bombing suspects. “I have no idea what kind of crazy ideas they have going on in their head.”

The two suspects, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan, 26, lived in Dagestan, a region in Russia that borders Chechnya, and in Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic that is now independent, before coming to the United States as children. But they had never lived in Chechnya itself.

“Any attempt to make a connection between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if they were guilty, is futile,” Ramzan A. Kadyrov, Chechnya’s leader, said in a post on Instagram. “They were raised in the United States and their views and convictions formed there. The roots of evil must be sought in America.”

None of the Chechens interviewed said they had more than a passing knowledge of the Tsarnaev brothers, who are accused of killing three people and wounding more than 170 in the bombing at the marathon and then going on a rampage that left one police officer dead and another struggling to survive.  28-year-old Chechen immigrant, who refused to be named because he feared reprisals against his family in Chechnya, said that there were, at most, five or six Chechen families living in the Boston area, but they had little contact with one another. He said he visited the Tsarnaevs’ home two years ago, after Anzor Tsarnaev, the suspects’ father, returned from a hospital stay.  He said Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a shootout with the police on Friday, was “a nice guy, physically strong and very funny.” Beyond that, he said, he knew little about the family.

Some Chechens say they have felt uneasy since the suspects’ background was revealed. And at least one senator has already evoked the Boston attack in a call for stricter immigration laws.

“It’s something they are very nervous about because there is a history of ethnic discrimination and suspicion against them in Russia,” said Almut Rochowanski, of the Chechnya Advocacy Network, which works with Chechen refugees in the United States. “I have actually had to calm down my Chechen-American contacts and assuage their fears, telling them things like Americans have dealt with this issue long enough now to know not to discriminate against entire groups.”

Albina Digaeva, 34, who fled in 1998 and now studies at a Los Angeles college, said she was afraid to take the subway after learning the suspects were Chechen.

“Maybe it was an overreaction, but it was my initial reaction,” said Ms. Digaeva, who is an observant Muslim and wears a head scarf. “It’s just that after living through the war and experiencing that in Russia, it just brought back all these memories.”

Amrina Sugaipova, a linguist who moved to Portland, Ore., from Chechnya in 2001 said she was distressed by some portrayals of Chechens in the news media since the bombing suspects’ identities and backgrounds were released.

“I’ve read all kinds of stories with people saying very negative things about the nation,” she said, referring to Chechnya. “I really hope Chechens won’t be profiled here, but I suspect they are going to be following every step we do.”

Mr. Tepsurkaev was just as pessimistic.

“Now when I meet someone, and they ask where I’m from, it will be difficult to say that I am Chechen,” he said. “I fear that it will affect my relationships with Americans.”
