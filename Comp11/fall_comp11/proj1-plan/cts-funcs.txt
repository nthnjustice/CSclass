	is inputted, this function outputs that the user requested an invalid command
o	Arguments: This function accepts the following commands: RQ, CA, PR, QU.
o	Return Value: This function returns its values to Int Main (). 
o	Effects: There are no specific effects for this function.
o	Notes: This function is the primary body of the program. It needs

	high price seat, low price seat, or any seat. 
o	Argument: This function uses the 2-D array that is the concert seating.
o	Return Value: This function returns the reserved seats to the Input 
	Command function.
o	Effects: There are no specific effects for this function.
o	Notes: This function needs to be able to accept
 	the three different seating options and reject any illegal 
	requests. The function will call the 2-D array structs from 
	subsequent functions.
	
High Price
o	Purpose: This function is ran when the user chooses to reserve 
	a high price seat. It reserves the seat in the 2-D array 
	in the appropriate high-price section. 
o	Argument: This function uses the 2-D array that is the 
	concert seating.
o	Return Value: This function returns a 
	specific struct into the 2-D array.
o	Effect: There are no specific effects for this function.
o	Notes: Remember, this function returns values as 
	structs into the 2-D array.
Low Price
o	Purpose: This function is ran when the user chooses to
 	reserve a low price seat. It reserves the seat in the 
	2-D array in the appropriate low-price section.
o	Argument: This function uses the 2-D array that 
	is the concert seating.
o	Return Value: This function returns a specific 
	struct into the 2-D array.
o	Effect: There are no specific effects for this function.
o	Notes: Remember, this function returns values as 
	structs into the 2-D array.
Any Price
o	Purpose: This function is ran when the user does
 	not choose a specific seat price. The function 
	will automatically reserve seats in the high-price 
	section if space is available.
 	If space is not available, this function will 
	assign the user to seats in the low-price seating.
o	Argument: This function uses the 2-D array that 
	is the concert seating. 
o	Return Value: This function returns a specific
 	struct into the 2-D array.
o	Effect: There are no specific effects for this function.
o	Notes: Remember to make two condition for this 
	function; one if high-price seating is available, 
	and one if high-price seating is unavailable.
10% off for split party
o	Purpose: This function takes 10% off the price 
	of the ticket if the number of reserved seats has

	that represents the concert seating. This function 
	works for high, low, and any price ticket requests.
o	Argument: This function will take in the stuct 
	of the high, low, and any price functions.
o	Return Value: If this function is executed, it

o	Argument: This function will take in the structs 
	from the request seat function that are stored in the 
	input command function.
o	Return Value: This function will return an ?Empty? 
	struct to the appropriate position in the 2-D array.
o	Effect: This function will remove what?s stored 
	in structs form other functions.
o	Notes: No specific notes for this function.
Print out Seating Chart
o	Purpose: This function will print the 
	seating chart and show who has what seats reserved and where.
o	Argument: This function will take in the 2-D array built from the
