Good day,

Welcome to my program.

First thing's first: After publishing my programs to the website I have come to
find that neither my bbchecker nor my bbsolver works correctly. Regrettably,
I need to submit incomplete programs. I'm in a position in which I can no 
longer afford time to continue this assignment. I've written all of my
functions, I believe my algorithms are sound, and I've attempted to complete
each requirement for this assignment. I hope I wrote redeeming code. 

I would like to start with BogScorer.cpp. I utilize a linked-list to store the
words and their validity that the user submits. The linked-list is composed of
Nodes that store the valditiy as a string ("OK" or "NO"), the word, the nubmer
of points the word receives, and a pointer to another Node. First I build the
linked-list with all of the words and their validity. Next I iterate through
the list and allocate points according to the length of the word. Lastly I 
iteratre through the list again and total all of the points. I then print the
results. 

Next is BogSolver.cpp. BogSolver takes in a dictionary. I used the dictionary 
provided to us. Next the program takes in dimensions for a Boggle boad and it 
builds the board and fills it with letters sent in from main. The board
is a 2D dynamic arrays of a struct called Tile. A Tile consists of a letter
stored as a string and a boolean that indicates whether or not the cell has
been visited by the search function. The function also has a BogWordList struct
that represents a list of all the words in the boggle board found by the 
program. I also have various print functions. One that prints all of the words
in the HBF format, one that prints all words of a desired length in HBF format,
one that prints all the words as a list, and one that prints all the words of
a desired length in a list. My solve() function builds a valid word from board
Tiles. The functions calls the traverse() function, which is recursive by 
nature. The function searches the word, checking each Node and all of it's 
neighbors as it builds prefixes. Once a word is constructed, it is stored
in the list.
