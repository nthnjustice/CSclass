A gap will yawn, achingly, day by day, 
it will turn into a colossal pit, an abyss without foundation, 
a gradual invasion of words by margins, blank and insignificant, 
so that all of us, to a man, will find nothing to say.

And my Black bird, still not quitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On that pallid bust -- still flitting through my dolorous domain;
But it cannot stop from gazing for it truly finds amazing
That, by artful paraphrasing, I such rhyming can sustain--
Notwithstanding my lost symbol I such rhyming still sustain--
Though I shan't try it again!‚Äù
