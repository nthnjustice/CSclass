This repository showcases projects and assignments assigned during my time enrolled in COMP20 - Web Programming, at Tufts University.

My favorite project was Assignment 2, the Maurauder's Map. I have keen academic and professional interest in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and utilizing the Google Maps API was an enjoyable integration of GIS and computer science. 

From the start of this course, I can say with utmost confidence that my skills in web development have grown remarkably. Additionally, my general understaning of "how the web works" and how to learn independently have been profoundly bolstered. 

The most important thing I learned in this course was a basic understanding of web security - an example being how susceptible many websites are because many developers have a poor understanding of "how the web works". Another important thing I learned is to avoid "reinventing the wheel" at all costs. While developing a project, odds are another person has struggled with the same obstacle you may be facing. It's a good idea to search the web for answers before you get too frustrated with yourself. A specific example is present in my Assignment 3. I wasn't sure how to enable CORS, but a simple Google search yielded the 3 lines necessary to make my web-application function

This course has revealed to me that although I thoroughly enjoy server-side development, I find much more joy and gratification working on the front-end. Specifically speaking, I love working with Javascript and JQuery - I could imagine myself making sites more user friendly with interactive features and animation. 

P.S.

Thank you Ming, I've thoroughly enjoyed this class!
