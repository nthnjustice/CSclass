1) All aspects of the assignment have been correctly implemented

2) I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with anyone else

3) I spent approximately 2.5 hours on this assignment. 

For 99% of that time, I was stuck trying to make the following code work:

background: url('software.png') -128 0px;

I FINALLY realized I was missing a "px" after "-128". 

Once I got "background: url('software.png') -128px 0px;" working, the assignment took less than 5 minutes.
